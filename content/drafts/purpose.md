As I work through the first rough drafts for this site I am contemplating...

* The purpose that I am creating it
* What I would like it to be in the end
* And what needs to be done inorder to accomplish that goal


__Cause__: I have read in multiple places that in order to have a successful project one needs to feel
strongly about what he is trying to achieve.  While there are multiple reasons I am creating this site and
soon project specific sites there are a couple of overarching interests driving the development.

* The bleak prospects for the long term health of free software in the current trend of SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS implementations

    The current open core trend of projects using free and opensource software to kickstart "cloud" services
    and projects and then adding their propriatry (secret sauce) layer of code is disturbing on several fronts.

    * Lock-in: TBS
    * Loss of control of data: TBS
    * Easy entry but high cost of success:

* The get rich quick structure of the startup culture.

    Rather than working to to develop an environment where people people their lives working on interesting
    projects that provide long term benefits the current culture stresses the ability to create a 
    hit viral product that can be quickly monitized with the hope of hitting it rich.

__Goal__: Ultimately I would like this site to be a Free Software and 
Open Culture reference that independent and small team developers can
use to set up their own sites and projects.  In particular decentralized and distributed free software
projects that push the bounds of an open web.

As such while I work on my own projects I hope to...

* First document the specific configurations used to develop and run my projects.  
* Then to extract the information in those configurations into a cookbook style web book
  that would allow a developer to find information relevant to his tasks.
* And finally provide blog posts like this one that explains the context of why I decided
  to do things in a certain way.

__Plan__:

Those who know me know that I enjoy the journey of figuring out how to do something but
at times have issues staying the course until the end once I know where I am going.  By its nature
this site will be a continous work in progress that will hopefully reflect my current interests.
