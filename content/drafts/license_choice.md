IP is a Chimera
===========================================================
Philosophically I am an Intellectual Property (IP) minimalist.

* The name IP intentionally confuses (??? can't think of the word ???) the issue
    Primarily because IP is a misnomer that
    creates an artificial it is
    not property but just an artificial construct created in law to limit peoples usage of
    their real property.

* IP law should be scrapped
    * Disolve copywrite and trademark
    * Limited trademark and trade secret

* Historically it did damage but it could be limited


* Personal preference
If I didn't feel compelled to try to change the system I would use [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/)
for my code or [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) for my written works.
Those idealists reading this I strongly recommend you use them.  


Damages caused by the current system
===========================================================

* anti-competative
* Sacrafices a users rights to his personal property
    - License agreements to bypass first sale doctrine
    - GMO patents to prevent farmers from using their own seed



Hacking the System
===========================================================

* Fan of the idea of hacking the law
* My goals
* Strong copyleft
    * Viral nature is a good thing 
* Follow the rules, don't ignore them, do something about it
