Site Structure
=========================================================
This site is broken down into several areas

* The [Cookbook](/cookbook/) section is intended to grow into a software development and integration cookbook with recipes describing how to perform a specific task.

* The [Config](/config/) section gives the verbatim steps used to perform an action.  They can be used to try to reproduce a specific configuration or as a reference on what was needed to complete an action.

* The [About](/about/) section gives general information about this site and me.
