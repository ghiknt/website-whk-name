<h2>Site Structure</h2>

This site is broken down into several areas

<ul>
 <li> The <a href="/cookbook/">Cookbook</a> section is intended to grow into a software development and integration cookbook with recipes describing how to perform a specific task.

 <li> The <a href="/config/">Config</a> section gives the verbatim steps used to perform an action.  They can be used to try to reproduce a specific configuration or as a reference on what was needed to complete an action.

 <li> The <a href="/about/">About</a> section gives general information about this site and me.

</ul>
