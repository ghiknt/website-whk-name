<h2 property="name">whk's thoughts</h2>


This is my site to share what I have been working on and
to provide a stable URL for
<span property="author" typeof="Person"><a property="sameAs" typeof="URL" href="https://whk.name/about/me/#id">my identity</a>. 

The site is broken down into several areas

<ul>
 <li> The <a href="/cookbook/">Cookbook</a> section is intended to grow into a software development and integration cookbook with recipes describing how to perform a specific task.

 <li> The <a href="/config/">Config</a> section gives the verbatim steps used to perform an action.  They can be used to try to reproduce a specific configuration or as a reference on what was needed to complete an action.

 <li> The <a href="/about/">About</a> section gives general information about this site and me.

</ul>
